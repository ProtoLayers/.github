## Who We Are

We are a collective of researchers, developers, and blockchain specialists dedicated to bridging the gap in technically-oriented crypto events. Our community consists of contributors from leading projects across the Ethereum ecosystem, including protocol developers, researchers, and technical leaders working on:

- Layer 2 scaling solutions
- Zero-knowledge systems
- Account abstraction
- Cross-chain protocols
- Virtual machines for blockchain
- Fully homomorphic encryption
- Hardware acceleration for ZK proofs

## What We Do

We organize deeply technical conferences that foster collaboration and drive innovation in modular blockchain technology. Our events are designed to:

- Facilitate high-impact technical discussions on cutting-edge blockchain development
- Create spaces for hands-on workshops and practical implementation
- Incubate new EIPs and technical proposals
- Connect builders working on complementary solutions
- Advance the state of the art in Ethereum scaling and privacy

## Our Goals

1. Technical Advancement
   - Accelerate the development of modular blockchain solutions
   - Facilitate knowledge sharing between research and implementation teams
   - Drive adoption of best practices in protocol development

2. Community Building
   - Create sustainable collaboration networks between builders
   - Support open-source development initiatives
   - Bridge gaps between academic research and practical implementation

3. Ecosystem Growth
   - Incubate new technical solutions for Ethereum scaling
   - Foster interoperability between different Layer 2 solutions
   - Advance the state of zero-knowledge technology implementation
